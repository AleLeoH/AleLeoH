 # Hi, I'm Alexander 🌈👨🏻‍💻
I am a 17 year old trans guy who hopes to become one of the best game developers there are.
I want tobe remembered as a game developer that created games that made people feel seen and made them happy.
 I’m currently learning HTML, python and C++

 Some of the things I am passionate about are; lgbt rights, fiction, creating code with my freinds, and making a difference.
